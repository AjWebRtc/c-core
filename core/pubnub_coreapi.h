    with the following keys:

    - "action": the event that happened, can be "leave", "join", "timeout",

    There is no special support for these (pseudo) channels in our

    that "combined" name. For example, to receive presence events on
    channel "my_channel", subscribe to "my_channel-pnpres".

    "presence" channel at the same time, and you'll receive both the
